## Requirements
1. Install Python dependencies using `conda env create -f environment.yml`

## Usage

1. Run the `download_data.sh` script to download the raw title and abstracts of the `ogbn-arxiv` dataset.
2. `NaiveBayes.ipyb` contains the code to replicate the Naive Bayes model.
3. `LDA_LogisticRegression.ipynb` contains the code to replicate the LDA+LR model.
4. `LDA_DNN.ipynb` contains the code to replicate the LDA+DNN model. This uses the data generated by the `LDA_LogisticRegression.ipynb` notebook.
